Shakespeare's "The Tempest" -Introduction

Prospero uses magic to conjure a storm and torment the survivors of a shipwreck, including the King of Naples and 
Prospero’s treacherous brother, Antonio. Prospero’s slave, Caliban, plots to rid himself of his master, but is 
thwarted by Prospero’s spirit-servant Ariel. The King’s young son Ferdinand, thought to be dead, falls in love with
Prospero’s daughter Miranda. Their celebrations are cut short when Prospero confronts his brother and reveals his identity 
as the usurped Duke of Milan. The families are reunited and all conflict is resolved. Prospero grants Ariel his freedom and
prepares to leave the island.
